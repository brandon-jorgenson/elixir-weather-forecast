# WeatherForecast

The WeatherForecast app helps you find the average max temperature over the next six days (including the current day) for three specific cities.

Those cities are: Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and Boise.

The [MetaWeather API](https://www.metaweather.com/api) is used to retrieve the data.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `weather_forecast` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:weather_forecast, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/weather_forecast](https://hexdocs.pm/weather_forecast).
